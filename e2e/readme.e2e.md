# How to run the end to end tests

Run the website from a command console:

- `cd [project root]`
- `npm run serve`

Run the "End to End" tests from a second command console:

- `cd [project root]`
- `npm run test-e2e`

**Note:** prior to running tests for the first time, you will need to install Playwright by running the following
command:
`npx playwright install

# To run the unit tests

- `npm run test`
